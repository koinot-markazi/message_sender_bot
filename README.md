# Message Sender Bot

Simple Telegram Bot which sends messages to the channel from bot.
This bot based on nodeJS and with the framework telegraf.js.

I don't know what to write on open-source project description, but it is completely free and you can use this code for free:)
I have included comments almost for each line of code, if you are familiar with JavaScript code it is not much difficult.
